Summary

Each trace line tells your simulator what memory is accessed and how.

You divide the memory address into page number and offset (page size = 4 KB).

Your simulator checks if the page is in memory:

Hit → continue

Miss → bring page into memory, possibly evicting another page based on your enum policy.

Keep track of statistics: page faults, hits, writes, etc.
